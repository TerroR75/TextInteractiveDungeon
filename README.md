# LEARNING PROJECT #1 - TerrorDungeon

This is my first ever fun little learning project from 2021 for C# and game design in general.
"TerrorDungeon" - small, rpg, dungeon crawler console game.

## Features

- Random enemy generator

Enemies can have different prefixes and suffixes - both change base stats for enemies and with color coding indicates their "rarity". 
Image above shows [normal] zombie without suffix so it has common rarity.

Here however is a different outcome from generator for a more powerful enemy that has additional critical chance:

- Shop** with buying items for gold that are later stored on player's object:

** additionaly shop has random item generation as well with item rarity (blue one in this case)


- Saving and loading system (data serialization - I pretty much do not understand much nowadays and in 2021 I completely had no idea what I was writing, but it works!)

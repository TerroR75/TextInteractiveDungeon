# TextInteractiveDungeon
Everything here is in pre pre pre pre alpha.

About me:
  Hello to my Github! My name is Kamil and I am a selftaught beginner in programming. I am Trying to learn C# as my first language and hopefully Git will help me keep track of my progress and work.
Currently Im coding very simple applications and games with hopes for the future to get into more advanced stuff and understand more languages, frameworks and tools.

About this app:
  TextInteractiveDungeon is my first ever learning project that helps me build my knowledge and understanding of programming. As I said it is very simple, many things probably
could have been done better, but atleast im having fun and I feel like im learning something.



I know how this readme looks, it's bad but I will update it as soon as possible to make it better.
